# Robo Teacher Software By Robo-teacher Team

This study explored the potential of Robo-teacher, an assistant learning robot designed for pupils, which consisted of an AI named DiDi, 
a female AI instructor specifically developed to facilitate effective and comfortable learning. Focusing on English language subjects, 
Robo-teacher used interactive lessons, gamified activities, and personalized feedback to improve grammar, vocabulary, and conversation techniques 
while reducing communication anxiety and promoting active participation. It integrated AI-powered reading and communication instruction, multimedia 
for engaging learning experiences, interactive reading games, and tools to improve reading comprehension. Additionally, it assisted teachers with resources, 
personalized attention, and progress tracking for targeted instruction and student improvement. Preliminary results from pilot studies indicated positive impacts 
on pupil engagement and communication skill development. This research contributed to the growing field of robot-assisted language learning, exploring the potential 
of social robots to supplement traditional teaching methods and personalize the learning experience for pupils.
